# Vault Write

Create or update notes in `Docs/Vault/BookStore/`. For all structural rules — frontmatter format, folder layout, tag taxonomy, naming conventions, body guidelines, and link requirements — see `.github/instructions/vault.instructions.md`.

## Required tools

```bash
brew install ripgrep fd
```

## Inputs

- `topic` — what the note is about (normalize to lowercase for searches)
- `content` — note body (free text, sections, bullets)
- `intent` — optional: `add` or `update`; inferred from existence if absent
- `target` — optional: existing note path if already known

## Procedure

1. Read [docs](./references/docs.md) for the commands to load the live folder catalog, tag catalog, available templates, and detect existing notes. **Always load these at runtime — never use cached lists.**
2. **Detect intent** (`add` vs `update`):
   - If `target` is given and the file exists → `update`.
   - Otherwise search first: `rg -l --glob "*.md" --ignore-case --fixed-strings "<topic>" Docs/Vault/BookStore`.
   - One strong match (same scope/topic) → `update`; zero → `add`; multiple → ask the user or treat as `add`.
3. **Decide single vs multiple notes** (atomicity rule: one topic per note). Split when two clearly separable subjects would have distinct `type/*` or `component/*` tags.
4. **For each note:**
   1. Pick the folder from the live structure (see [docs](./references/docs.md) → Structure).
   2. Load the matching template from `07_Templates/`.
   3. Build the filename in `PascalCase-With-Dashes.md` matching existing siblings.
   4. Write frontmatter and body following vault.instructions.md rules and the loaded template.
   5. Add `[[Wikilinks]]` in the `## Related` section pointing to existing relevant notes.
5. **Cross-link**: add a `[[NewNote]]` reference in at least one logical parent note.
6. **Update indexes**: always update `00_Index/Navigation.md`; also update `00_Index/Tags.md` if a new tag was introduced, and `00_Index/Home.md` if a new folder was created.
7. Return a bullet list of each note path created or updated, the `type/*` and key tags chosen, any new tags introduced, and any `TODO:` items left for the caller.

## Rules

- Always search before adding to avoid duplicates.
- Never hard-code folders, tags, or templates — read them live.
- Never invent tags or folders silently — update `00_Index/Tags.md` / `00_Index/Home.md` in the same change.
- **Never embed external links directly in notes outside `06_References/`.** Create a `type/reference` note in `06_References/` with the link and key-point summary, then `[[Wikilink]]` to it from the engineering/operational note.
- See [examples](./references/examples.md) for common scenarios.
